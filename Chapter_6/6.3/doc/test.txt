aspects of our behavior and tendencies while seeking to eliminate those that might be disruptive.
Agriculture, one might say, has involved the domestication of the human being as much as of any plant
or other animal.2
Our sense of the full range of human nature, like our diet, has been steadily reduced. No matter
how nourishing it might be, anything wild gets pulled—though as we’ll see, some of the weeds
growing in us have roots reaching deep into our shared past. Pull them if you want, but they’ll just
keep coming back again and again.
What gets cultivated—in soil and minds—is not necessarily beneficial to the individuals in a
given society. Something may benefit a culture overall, while being disastrous to the majority of the
individual members of that society. Individuals suffer and die in wars from which a society may
benefit greatly. Industrial poisons in the air and water, globalized trade accords, genetically modified
crops...all are accepted by individuals likely to end up losing in the deal.
This disconnect between individual and group interests helps explain why the shift to agriculture
is normally spun as a great leap forward, despite the fact that it was actually a disaster for most of the
individuals who endured it. Skeletal remains taken from various regions of the world dating to the
transition from foraging to farming all tell the same story: increased famine, vitamin deficiency,
stunted growth, radical reduction in life span, increased violence...little cause for celebration. For
most people, we’ll see that the shift from foraging to farming was less a giant leap forward than a
dizzying fall from grace
